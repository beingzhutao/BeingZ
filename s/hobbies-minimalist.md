🧐 Through minimalism, I have discovered my purpose in life and found joy in the simple things. Instead of constantly chasing after material possessions, I am now focused on experiences and relationships. 🤝

💪 I am still decluttering little by little each day, and it feels great to let go of things that no longer serve a purpose in my life. It's amazing how much lighter and more organized I feel when I have less stuff. 🗑️

It's been almost 4 years since I discovered Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus and their message of minimalism. They have been such an inspiration to me and have helped me stay on track with my journey. ❤️
