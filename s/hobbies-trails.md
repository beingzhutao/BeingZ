## Trails

👣🌿 There's something magical about following a trail and seeing where it leads. Whether it's through a dense forest, over rolling hills, or along a babbling brook, I'm always up for an adventure on a beautiful trail. 🌄

🏞️ If you love hiking, you're going to want to check out my latest post! 🙌🏼 Because let's be real, the overlap between hiking and trails is pretty significant 😉 Click the link [Hiking page](/s/hobbies-hiking) to see more of my favorite hiking spots and trails to explore! 🌳🍁🍂


🥾🌲 Hiking vs. Trails: what's the difference? 🤔🧐

👉🏼 Hiking is the activity of **walking on natural pathways** or trails, typically in mountainous or forested areas, for recreational purposes. 🏞️ It involves walking over uneven terrain, and may involve ascending and descending slopes or hills. 🏔️

👉🏼 Trails, on the other hand, are the **designated paths** or routes used for hiking, walking, running, or biking. 🚴‍♂️ They can be natural or man-made and are typically marked or maintained for easy navigation. 🗺️ Trails can be found in parks, forests, and other outdoor recreation areas.

So, whether you're hiking on a trail or just enjoying a leisurely walk, get outside and enjoy nature! 🌿🌳🌻
