## My Career

👩🔬My Career: How did I get interested in biochemistry, computational chemistry, and math? 🧪📈

Growing up, I always had a natural curiosity for science and math. I was fascinated by the way the world worked and the role that science played in understanding it. As I entered college, I became particularly drawn to the fields of biochemistry, computational chemistry, and math.

🔍 Biochemistry: The study of the chemical processes that occur within living organisms. I was intrigued by the idea of understanding how molecules interact within the body to create life.

💻 Computational Chemistry: The use of computer simulations to study chemical systems. This field allowed me to combine my love for chemistry with my interest in technology and programming.

🧮 Math: The foundation of all science, math is a fundamental tool for understanding the natural world. I found that a strong foundation in math was crucial for success in both biochemistry and computational chemistry.

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of interesting projects. I've used computational methods to study the binding of drugs to protein targets, and I've worked on developing new algorithms to improve the accuracy of molecular simulations. I've also been involved in research projects focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of disease and developing new treatments.

As I prepare to embark on the next phase of my career, I find myself faced with a number of exciting opportunities. While I'm not entirely sure where I'll end up, I know that I'm passionate about both research and teaching. One option is to work for a company that focuses on drug discovery or computational chemistry. Another option is to pursue a career in teaching, sharing my knowledge and love of chemistry with high school students.

Alternatively, I may decide to create my own business. As an entrepreneur, I would have the opportunity to create something new and innovative in the field of chemistry, whether it be a new technology or a new approach to teaching.

🎓 **Whatever path I choose, I know that my passion for science will guide me.** I'm excited to see where my career takes me, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to pursue my dreams. #Biochemistry #CareerGoals #Entrepreneurship #Teaching #Chemistry #Research #Science
