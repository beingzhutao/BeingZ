🧩🔍📚 Puzzles have always been a favorite pastime of mine. From mazes to Sudoku, I love the challenge of finding a solution. But one of my favorite puzzles of all time has to be solving [NMR spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy)! 🧪🤓

I used to practice NMR spectrum solving all the time, and I have to say, there's something incredibly satisfying about cracking the code and finding the solution. 🤩 But lately, I've been exploring other types of puzzles, like [mazes](https://krazydad.com/), [star battles](https://krazydad.com/), and [word searches.](https://thewordsearch.com/) 🌟🔠

Mazes are a great way to exercise your problem-solving skills, as you have to navigate through a complex labyrinth to find your way out. And with star battles, you have to strategically place stars on a grid to create constellations while avoiding obstacles. 🌌

Sudoku is a classic puzzle that challenges your logical thinking and problem-solving abilities. And with word searches, you have to find hidden words within a jumble of letters, testing your attention to detail and concentration. 🤔🔍

While I may not be practicing NMR spectrum solving as much these days, I still love the satisfaction of solving a good puzzle. Whether it's a classic like [Sudoku](https://krazydad.com/) or something new like star battles, puzzles are a great way to exercise your brain and have some fun in the process! 🤩🧠
