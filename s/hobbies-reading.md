📚📖 Since I was young, I've always loved reading books! 🤓📖 However, growing up in China, I didn't have access to many resources, so I didn't read as much as I would have liked to until college. 📚🌟

During my 4 years in college, I read almost 500 books on science, novels, and more! 📚💡 After graduation, I even won the first prize for borrowing the most books from my college library. 🥇

Today, I still love to read books, but I prefer to read them online as PDFs or ePubs because I'm a minimalist. 🌿 Another reason is that I don't know where I'll end up in the future. But if I ever start a family, you can bet that I'll be stocking up on paperback books to fill my shelves! 📚👨‍👩‍👧

What about you? Do you prefer to read physical books or digital copies? Let me know in the comments below! 👇🤔 #readinglist #bookworm #minimalist #digitalreading #college

## Books that have had the greatest influence on my life


Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life by Joshua Fields Millburn, Ryan Nicodemus.

Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking - Christopher Hadnagy, Paul Wilson. 

The Stranger by Albert Camus.


## My favorite authors

Albert Camus (1913-1960) was a representative of non-metropolitan French literature. The Stranger by Albert Camus is the best.
