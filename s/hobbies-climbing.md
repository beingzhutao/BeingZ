## Climbing

🧗‍♀️🌄🏋️‍♂️ #RockClimbing #FirstTimeExperience #GradStudent #ClimbingGym #SavingMoney #PracticeMakesPerfect

The first time I went to a rock climbing gym as an adult in the USA as a graduate student, I felt like a visitor from another planet 🚀. But, I decided to give it a shot and try the first lesson in the climbing gym, and it turned out to be so attractive! 💪

Unfortunately, the trails to the climbing gym were getting expensive for me, so I decided to look for alternatives. That's when I discovered my school gym, which is free to access 🏋️‍♂️. I started to practice my toes and fingers to improve my climbing skills, which allowed me to visit the climbing gym less often and save some money 💰.

To improve my skills, I learned from other people who were also staying at the gym. They were more than happy to help and give me tips on how to climb better 🧐. I also watched a lot of videos about climbing, which proved to be really helpful in my progress.

I don't have specific shoes for rock climbing, but I do have a pair of hiking shoes 👟. Whenever I'm out exploring and come across a rock formation, I can't resist the urge to try and climb it! Of course, I only attempt small rocks since I don't have any safety equipment 🙅‍♀️.

But it's still such an adventure to see what I can accomplish with just my hiking shoes and a little determination 🏔️. Who knows, maybe one day I'll invest in some proper climbing gear and take on bigger challenges! 🤞

Ever since I was a child, I've always loved climbing trees 🌳. LOL. There's something about being up high that makes me feel free and alive. And now, as an adult, I'm ready to take on a new challenge - climbing higher with skills 🧗‍♀️.

I believe that with practice and determination, I can climb higher than ever before. It's not just about reaching the top, it's about the journey and pushing myself to be better. I'm excited to see how far I can go!

If you're interested in [getting started with rock climbing](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/getting-started-rock-climbing.html), my suggestion is to try it out at a climbing gym near you 🧗‍♀️. But if it's too expensive, consider practicing at a school gym or any other place where you can train your fingers and toes. Remember, practice makes perfect 🙌.
