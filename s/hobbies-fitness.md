## Fitness

🌳🧗‍♀️ To when I used to climb trees all the time as a child! I remember feeling so free and adventurous, and I always wanted to see how high I could go with just my toes and fingers. 💪 Now that I'm older, I'm excited to take that same sense of adventure and challenge to the climbing ! 🧗‍♂️

I go to my school gym every 2 days with the purpose of becoming stronger in my fingers and feet, specifically to improve my rock climbing skills. 🧗‍♀️ I can already feel myself getting better every day. 🏋️‍♂️

It's amazing how pursuing fitness goals can bring back childhood memories and inspire us to push ourselves to new heights (literally!). 🌳💪
