# Cooking

🍜🌮🥞🍗 I cook a lot almost every day! In the morning and noon, I usually cook something like noodles, lettuce, spicy eggs, and tacos. For lunch, I go for cheese pasta and fine noodles with pepper and lettuce. In the evening, I love pancakes and fried chicken, and for dinner, it's fried pasta, elbow pasta with a big plate of chicken, and pasta butter. 

I also enjoy pumpkin porridge and sweet potato with sugar. Canned corn and chicken soup are also great options, and when I'm feeling lazy, frozen pizza and bagels with cream cheese are my go-to.

My favorite foods to cook are lasagna, my homemade tacos, cream cheese pasta, and pumpkin porridge. I love adding cinnamon and spice to my dishes to give them an extra kick!

When it comes to Asian food, I don't cook it very often, but I love eating it at restaurants. It's quite complicated, but I can make a mean plate of fried rice with eggs.

I usually look up recipes on [Whisk](https://whisk.com/) and then customize them to my taste. Cooking brings me so much joy, and I love discovering new ingredients and flavors. Plus, it's healthy, and I can cook whatever I want to eat! 🍴👩‍🍳
