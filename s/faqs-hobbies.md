## Hobbies

I wanted to share some of my favorite hobbies with you! As a scientist, I find it important to have hobbies outside of work to relax and recharge. Here are a few things I love to do:

🧩 Puzzles: There's something so satisfying about completing a challenging puzzle, and it's a great way to unwind at the end of the day.

📚 Reading: I love diving into a good book and getting lost in the story. Whether it's fiction or non-fiction, reading is a great way to learn and expand your mind.

🌄 Hiking: There's nothing like getting outside and exploring nature. Hiking is a great way to exercise and clear your mind, and the views from the top of a mountain are always worth it!

🧗‍♂️ Climbing: For a more adventurous way to get outside, I love rock climbing. It's a great physical and mental challenge, and there's a real sense of accomplishment when you reach the top.

📸 Photography: When I'm out hiking or climbing, I always bring my camera with me. Capturing the beauty of nature is one of my favorite things to do, and it's a great way to preserve memories of my adventures.

🚶‍♂️ Minimalism: As a minimalist, I find joy in simplifying my life and focusing on what truly matters. It's a constant process, but it's rewarding to live with less and appreciate the things that really bring me happiness.

🌄 Adventure: Whether it's hiking, climbing, or exploring a new city, I love trying new things and stepping out of my comfort zone.

🕹️ Games: When I need to unwind and relax, I love playing games, whether it's a board game with friends or a video game on my own.

🎬 Movies: There's nothing like getting lost in a good movie, and I love everything from indie films to big-budget blockbusters.

🍁 Trails: I love exploring new hiking trails and finding hidden gems in nature. It's a great way to get some exercise and discover new places.

💪 Fitness: Staying active and healthy is important to me, and I enjoy working out regularly to maintain my physical and mental wellbeing.

🍳 Cooking: Trying out new recipes in the kitchen is a great way to get creative and experiment with flavors and ingredients.

🎙️ Podcast: When I'm out for a walk or doing chores around the house, I love listening to podcasts. There's so much great content out there, and it's a great way to learn and stay informed.
