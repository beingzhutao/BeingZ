## Writing

check out my  [writing corner page](/s/book-writing-corner)

Ever since I was young, I have always loved writing. Writing has been a way for me to express myself and to capture the basic happenings in my life. I have always enjoyed putting my thoughts and feelings into words on paper.

As I grew older, my love for writing never faded. In fact, I have continued to write even more. Recently, I have decided to switch my writing language from Chinese to English, and I am really enjoying it so far.

Writing in English has allowed me to explore new perspectives and to challenge myself. It has been a great learning experience, and I feel like I am constantly growing as a writer.

If you're interested in seeing more of my writing, be sure to check out my [writing corner page](/s/book-writing-corner). You'll find a collection of books and stories that I have written over the years. I hope that my writing can inspire others to pursue their own passions and to never stop learning and growing.
