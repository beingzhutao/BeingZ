## My motherland

🇨🇳 As I reminisce about my childhood in the motherland China, I am filled with nostalgia for the simple yet joyful memories I have. Growing up in the countryside meant spending most of my time playing outside and helping my family with farm work. 🌾

During summer vacations, I would spend my days catching fish and shrimp to earn some pocket money. Learning how to catch fish and shrimp was not only a fun activity but also a valuable skill that has stayed with me throughout my life. 🐟

My primary school was located in a different village, and most of the teaching facilities were broken. Compared to now, we had limited resources for education, with almost only Chinese and mathematics classes offered almost every day. Despite the lack of art education, I did not let that stop me from pursuing my passion for art. I taught myself the art skills I needed when I was in college. 🏫

At home, we grew wheat and rice, and during the summer, I would help my family with the harvest and drying process. One of my fondest memories is sitting on a tractor full of wheat and rice, surrounded by the sweet scent of harvest. 🌾

Even though I have not been to another city since I turned 18, I am grateful for the memories and experiences I have had in the motherland China. I may not have traveled to other cities, but I have created many memorable moments in my hometown that I will cherish forever. 🙏

Living in the countryside allowed me to connect with nature and appreciate the simple things in life. The beautiful landscapes and scenic views of the countryside are unmatched, and I am fortunate to have grown up in such a serene environment. 🌳

Despite the lack of resources and technology, I learned valuable life lessons and skills that have stayed with me throughout my life. The hard work and dedication that I witnessed in my family and community have inspired me to work hard and chase my dreams. 💪

The motherland China has a rich cultural heritage that I am proud of. The delicious cuisine, traditional festivals, and ancient landmarks are just a few examples of the cultural richness that China has to offer. 🥟

I am grateful for the education that I received, despite the limited resources. The Chinese language and mathematics have been integral to my personal and professional growth, and I will always cherish the skills and knowledge I gained. 📚

As I reflect on my childhood in the motherland China, I am reminded of the importance of family, hard work, and perseverance. The memories and experiences I have had in my hometown will always hold a special place in my heart. ❤️
