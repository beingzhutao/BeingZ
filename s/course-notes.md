## Chemistry Course notes
*Chemistry Coursework and Lecture Notes*

*Description: üî¨üìù Finally sorting through my chemistry lecture notes and I'm excited to share some key takeaways with you all! üß™üí°*

---

üìùüíª As a student, I like to keep my notes organized and accessible. That's why I love using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)! With this simple markup language, I can take notes in real-time during my classes and easily convert them into PDFs for later use. ü§ìüìö

üöÄ Plus, with the ability to download and transfer my Markdown notes online, easily use one [online software](https://cloudconvert.com/md-to-pdf) convert markdown into PDFs for later use.üåéüì≤

üìù Taking advantage of my free time to jot down some notes! But let's face it, typos happen üòÖ If you spot any mistakes, please don't hesitate to send me a quick [email](/contact) üìß I would really appreciate it! üôè
