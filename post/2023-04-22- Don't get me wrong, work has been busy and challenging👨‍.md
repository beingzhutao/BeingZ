I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've been able to go on a hike or hit the nature trails. With work taking up so much of my time, I've had to make some sacrifices and put some of my favorite activities on hold. But I know that I'll be able to get back out there soon and continue doing what I love.

Don't get me wrong, work has been busy and challenging, but I've been able to stay focused and productive. I know that putting in the time and effort now will pay off in the long run, both personally and professionally.

Even though I haven't been able to go on any hikes lately, I've still been taking care of myself mentally and physically. 🗓️👣🌅🌄

Luckily, I've got a hike planned for next week, and I'm so excited to get back out into nature. There's just something so peaceful and refreshing about being surrounded by trees, mountains, and fresh air. I can't wait to see the sunrise or sunset on the trail and get a good workout in.

I've missed all the beautiful plants, flowers and wildlife that I get to see on my hikes. Nature has a way of putting things into perspective and reminding me of how small I am in this vast world. It's humbling and inspiring at the same time.

🙌🏼🌞🌊🌅

I'm grateful for the times that I've been able to experience the outdoors, and I look forward to making more memories in the future. It's important to make time for the things that bring us joy and make us feel alive, even when we're busy with other things.
