title: "I already have enough of these thingsðŸ™Œ"
---

It's become common to see organizations giving out free samples and gifts in my school, from t-shirts to power banks, toys, and more. But I've realized that I already have enough of these things, and they just end up cluttering my life. So, instead of taking them, I often politely decline and suggest they give them to someone who may need them more.

To me, this is a philosophy of minimalism - caring about what I truly need and valuing the importance of sharing. I don't want to accumulate unnecessary possessions, and I believe in only keeping what truly matters. This approach has helped me to declutter my life and focus on the things that truly matter.

When we declutter, we make space for what is truly important in our lives - experiences, relationships, and personal growth. We become more intentional about what we bring into our lives, and we learn to value the things that truly matter. It's not about living without, but rather living with intention and purpose.

So, next time you're offered a free gift or sample, consider if you really need it or if someone else could benefit from it more. Let's embrace a minimalist lifestyle and share what we can with others.
