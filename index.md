I am a graduate student at Rutgers University who has a great interest in chemistry.

I'm also an amateur programmer, I guess.

🧑‍🔬🔢 Love delving into biochemistry and computational chemistry.

🧪Biochemistry is my passion, and I can't wait to see what scientific discoveries the future holds! 🔬

🧩 When I'm not in the lab, you can find me climbing mountains 🧗‍♀️, hiking through nature 🌳, or diving into a good book 📚. 

📚 And of course, no day is complete without some good old-fashioned reading. Whether it's a classic novel or the latest scientific paper, I'm always eager to learn more and expand my knowledge. 📖
