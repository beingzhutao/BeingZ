I am a biophysical chemist. The duties of a biophysical chemist involve using computers to help perform experiments and research including single-molecule, bayesian inference, and machine learning. 

We study the motions of complex molecules, how they are organized, and how they enable chemistry in a sub-discipline of biophysical chemistry, aiming at understanding the molecular details of how bacteria sense the chemical composition of their environment with both experimental and theoretical investigations into the molecular details and the thermodynamic constraints underlying the accuracy of bacterial chemosensing abilities.
