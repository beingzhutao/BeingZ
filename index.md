*如果你想获得一个小时的快乐，那么睡觉；如果你想获得一天的快乐，那么去钓鱼；如果你想获得一年的快乐，那么继承一个财产；如果你想获得一生的快乐，那么帮助别人*

*Tranlation: "If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody." *

My name is Zhutao, and I am a graduate student at Rutgers University who has a great interest in chemistry. My CV is [here]({{ site.github.url }}/cv/CV-Zhutao.pdf). Here is a list of my major coursework from undergraduate and graduate school. These days, I’m interested in FRET Study. My papers are linked on my publications page,

You can visit my website [zhutaosheng.com](http://zhutaosheng.com/), and I am also available at the following places: [GitHub](https://github.com/zhutaosheng), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zhtuao.s), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@ZhutaoGuru), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/zhutao_s), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhutao-Sheng), [My Blogs](http://zhutaosheng.com/). 


I'm also an amateur programmer, I guess.

🧑‍🔬🔢 Love delving into biochemistry and computational chemistry.

🧪Biochemistry is my passion, and I can't wait to see what scientific discoveries the future holds! 🔬

🧩 When I'm not in the lab, you can find me climbing mountains 🧗‍♀️, hiking through nature 🌳, or diving into a good book 📚. 

📚 And of course, no day is complete without some good old-fashioned reading. Whether it's a classic novel or the latest scientific paper, I'm always eager to learn more and expand my knowledge. 📖
