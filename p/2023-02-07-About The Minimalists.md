üëãüèºüåø Hey there, friends! Today I want to share a blog post I came across on minimalism and the power of living with less.

üå±üí≠ Minimalism is all about simplifying your life and focusing on the things that truly matter. By getting rid of excess stuff and distractions, you can create more space for what brings you joy and fulfillment.

The original link of this blog from [theminimalists.com](https://www.theminimalists.com/about/)


At first glance, people might think the point of minimalism is only to get rid of material possessions: Eliminating. Jettisoning. Extracting. Detaching. Decluttering. Paring down. Letting go. But that‚Äôs a mistake.

True, removing the excess is an important part of the recipe‚Äîbut it‚Äôs just one ingredient. If we‚Äôre concerned solely with the stuff, we‚Äôre missing the larger point.

Minimalists don‚Äôt focus on having less, less, less. We focus on making room for more: more time, more peace, more creativity, more experiences, more contribution, more contentment, more freedom. Clearing the clutter frees up the space.

Minimalism is the thing that gets us past the things so we can make room for life‚Äôs important things, which aren‚Äôt things at all.

For The Minimalists, it all started with a lingering discontent. Nearly a decade ago, while approaching age 30, we had achieved everything that was supposed to make us happy: six-figure careers, luxury cars, oversized houses, and all the stuff to clutter every corner of our consumer-driven lives.

And yet with all those possessions, we weren‚Äôt satisfied. There was a gaping void, and working 80 hours a week just to buy more stuff couldn‚Äôt fill it. The long hours only introduced more debt, stress, anxiety, fear, loneliness, guilt, overwhelm, depression.

What‚Äôs worse, we didn‚Äôt have control of our time, and thus we didn‚Äôt control our own lives. So, in 2009, we took back control using the principles of [minimalism](http://theminimalists.com/minimalism). Read about our [21-day journey](http://theminimalists.com/21days) into minimalism.

Since starting this website, in 2010, we‚Äôve been fortunate enough to establish an audience of more than 20 million people. The Minimalists have been [featured](http://theminimalists.com/media) throughout the media, and we have [spoken](http://theminimalists.com/speaking) at Harvard Business School, Apple, and Google.

In 2011, we walked away from our corporate careers and published our first book, [_Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life_](http://theminimalists.com/lml). That same year, we went on an international book tour and eventually began contributing to people through Joshua‚Äôs online writing [class](http://theminimalists.com/class/) and Ryan‚Äôs minimalist-budgeting [course](https://www.theminimalists.com/budget/).

After we left the corporate world, we found time to contribute to several worthy causes. Over the past decade, The Minimalists have built two orphanages, provided relief to the victims of Hurricane Harvey, supported the survivors of the Orlando and Las Vegas mass shootings, funded a high school for a year in Kenya, installed clean-water wells in three countries, constructed an elementary school in Laos, and purchased thousands of mosquito nets to fight malaria in Africa. We recently [raised money](http://gemcitymarket.com/theminimalists) to build a not-for-profit grocery co-op in our hometown, Dayton, Ohio, which has one of the largest food deserts in the United States.

We moved from Dayton to a [cabin](http://theminimalists.com/montana) near Philipsburg, Montana, in 2012, as a four-month writing experiment, followed by a move to beautiful [Missoula](http://theminimalists.com/missoula), in 2013, where we cofounded [Asymmetrical Press](http://asymmetrical.co/about), a publishing house for the indie at heart.

We published our most popular book, the critically acclaimed memoir _[Everything That Remains](http://theminimalists.com/etr)_, in 2014, and then embarked on a 100-city [bookstore tour](https://www.facebook.com/pg/theminimalists/photos/?tab=album&album_id=560696864000430).

We published our third book, [_Essential: Essays by The Minimalists_](https://www.theminimalists.com/ee/), in 2015. That book presents a minimalist perspective on twelve different areas of life‚Äîfrom decluttering, gift-giving, and finances to passion, health, and relationships. That year, we also hit the road with five other authors and one musician for Asymmetrical Press‚Äô first-ever [WordTasting Tour](https://www.facebook.com/pg/theminimalists/photos/?tab=album&album_id=906977019372411).

We launched _[The Minimalists Podcast](http://theminimalists.com/podcast/)_, where we discuss living a meaningful life with less, in 2016. That same year, we, alongside our friends Sarah and Joshua Weaver, opened a coffeehouse in St. Petersburg, Florida: [Bandit Coffee Co.](http://theminimalists.com/coffeehouse) Then, on May 24, 2016, our documentary, _[Minimalism](http://minimalismfilm.com)_, was released in 400 theaters in the United States and Canada, opening as the #1 indie documentary of 2016. It is now available on Netflix, iTunes, and Amazon.

Once _Minimalism_ was streaming on Netflix, we hit the road for a 50-city [speaking tour](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1477219289014845.1073741835.108420932561361&type=1&l=31b63d3d3a). In each city, we presented an in-depth talk about minimalism. Pieces of that talk formed the foundation for our second documentary, _Less Is Now_.

We built a podcast and film studio in Hollywood, in 2018, in an effort to produce more meaningful audio and video creations, and we journeyed to the South with Dave Ramsey‚Äôs team for our [Simply Southern Tour](https://www.facebook.com/pg/theminimalists/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2084712594932175).

Throughout 2019 and 2020, we once again teamed up with director [Matt D‚ÄôAvella](https://youtu.be/nlDAPQT5d0A) and the folks at [Booklight](https://www.booklight.co/) to produce our second film, _[Less Is Now](https://youtu.be/jn-xbOCZOiQ)_, a Netflix Original documentary about starting over with less, which was released worldwide on January 1, 2021, and was nominated for an Emmy in 2022.

Joshua and his wife, Rebecca, launched _[How to Love](https://howtolove.show/)_, a podcast about relationships, sex, and parenting, in January 2021.

The Minimalists‚Äô fourth book, _[Love People Use Things](http://lovepeopleusethings.net)_, which examines life‚Äôs seven essential relationships, was published by Celadon/Macmillan on July 13, 2021, and became an instant _New York Times_‚Äìbestseller.

After eleven appearances on _The Minimalists Podcast_, the philosopher and educator [T.K. Coleman](https://www.instagram.com/officialtkcoleman/) officially became Joshua and Ryan‚Äôs podcast cohost in August 2022.

## About Joshua Fields Millburn

<img src="/assets/img/all-pics/Joshua-Fields-Millburn-About-Page-Photo.jpg" width="100%">

I was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1981. Because we grew up poor, I suspected our lack of happiness was birthed out of a lack of money. So when I turned eighteen, I skipped college and applied for an entry-level corporate job and spent the next decade climbing the corporate ladder, forsaking everything except the pursuit of money‚Äîbecause that was sure to make me happy, right?

In time, I became the youngest director in our company‚Äôs 140-year history. Even though I earned a remarkable income, I didn‚Äôt feel remarkable. I had accumulated the trinkets of success, but something was missing.

Then, in late 2009, my mother died and my marriage ended in the same month, which caused me to question everything: finances, freedom, the future. That‚Äôs when I [discovered minimalism](http://theminimalists.com/tweet). Now, more than a decade later, I probably own fewer than [288 things](http://theminimalists.com/288/), but I don‚Äôt actually [count my stuff](https://www.theminimalists.com/counting/).

A dozen years into chasing the American Dream, [I quit](http://theminimalists.com/quit/) my six-figure job, at age 30, to focus on writing full-time.

After spending the first 31 years of my life in Ohio, most recently in a [minimalist apartment](http://theminimalists.com/apartment) in downtown Dayton, I moved to Montana, in 2012, where I met my wife, [Rebecca](http://minimalwellness.com). We lived in a [minimalist home](http://theminimalists.com/millburn) in Missoula with our daughter,¬†[Ella](https://twitter.com/ellasandwich), until we moved into our [minimalist apartment](https://www.theminimalists.com/mht) in Los Angeles, in 2017.

I‚Äôm not a Stoic, and I‚Äôm certainly not a Luddite, but I enjoy conducting stoical experiments from time to time, like living without the [Internet](http://theminimalists.com/internet), living without a [phone](http://theminimalists.com/twitch), living without [purchasing things](http://theminimalists.com/failure), living without a [television](http://theminimalists.com/tv), and living without [goals](http://theminimalists.com/no-goals).

As an introvert [INTJ](http://theminimalists.com/alone), I used to be an extremely private person. Then I discovered Twitter. You can [follow me](https://twitter.com/jfm) for pithy musings and smart-aleck remarks. If that‚Äôs not enough, you can listen to some of my [favorite music](http://theminimalists.com/sound) and read my maundering answers to these [20 questions](https://www.theminimalists.com/20q/) about minimalism.

## Ryan‚Äôs Comments About Joshua

I‚Äôve known Josh since the fifth grade. My favorite memory is the first time I saw Josh eat an entire ten-pack of White Castle hamburgers at age ten. He was literally the fattest kid in our school. Oh, and he had a mullet until he was twelve. I can‚Äôt deny this unfortunate fact because there are [pictures](https://twitter.com/JFM/status/1346089380834807809/photo/1) to prove it. -JF

## About Ryan Nicodemus

<img src="/assets/img/all-pics/Ryan-Nicodemus-About-Page-Photo.jpg" width="100%">
  
I was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1981, and grew up in Southwest Ohio by way of Upstate New York. I now live in Los Angeles with my wife, Mariah. You can see a photo tour of our previous apartment in Missoula [here](http://theminimalists.com/nicodemus) and watch a video tour of our current apartment in Los Angeles [here](https://www.theminimalists.com/mht).

Although I grew up in a dysfunctional home without much money, I eventually struck gold in the corporate world. I was living the American Dream until [I was laid off](http://theminimalists.com/fired), but that‚Äôs actually one of the best things that‚Äôs ever happened to me. Now, ever since my [Packing Party](http://theminimalists.com/packing), in 2010, I‚Äôm focused on living a meaningful life with less stuff, and I‚Äôm pursuing my passions.

My deepest passion is mentoring people. I had a decade of mentoring and leadership experience in the corporate world, which I‚Äôve repurposed to help people get unstuck in their personal lives. But mentoring isn‚Äôt my only passion; I‚Äôm passionate about many things: snowboarding, wakeboarding, paddleboarding‚Äîpretty much any kind of boarding (except waterboarding).

As an extrovert [ENFP](http://www.personalitypage.com/ENFP.html), I‚Äôm the more social half of The Minimalists. If you like interesting, silly updates, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ryannicodemus) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/ryannicodemus).

#### Joshua‚Äôs Comments About Ryan

Ryan and I have nearly identical thought processes and values, but we are completely different people: I‚Äôm OCD, he‚Äôs ADD. I‚Äôm an introvert who loves alone time, Ryan is always the life of the party. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Ä≥, Ryan is ‚Ä¶ well ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say he‚Äôs shorter than six feet. Hey, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11¬æ‚Äù, and that totally rounds up to six feet! ‚ÄîRyan.
