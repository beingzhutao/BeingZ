💫 I just listened to my favorite podcast, [The Minimalists Podcast](https://www.theminimalists.com/podcast/), and I'm so excited to share some of the amazing things I learned! The podcast discussed three key concepts that really resonated with me.

🌟 First, "You can't change the people around you, but you can change the people around you." This means that while we can't control the people in our lives, we have the power to choose who we surround ourselves with. By surrounding ourselves with positive and supportive people, we can create a more fulfilling and enriching life.

💭 Second, "Once you're free from pleasing all the people, you're free from needing all the things." This was a powerful reminder that we don't need to please everyone in our lives. When we let go of the need for constant approval, we can focus on living our lives on our own terms and finding true happiness.

🕰️ And finally, "On a long enough timeline, you will let go of everything." This means that eventually, everything we own and everything we hold onto will be let go. This reminds us to live in the present moment and appreciate what we have, rather than holding onto material possessions that ultimately don't bring us lasting happiness.

🌟 These concepts have really inspired me to live life on my own terms and focus on what truly matters. **We don't need to live up to the expectations of others or accumulate material possessions to find happiness**. When we let go of these things and focus on what's truly important, we can lead a more fulfilling life.

👊🌟 So let's take charge of our lives and surround ourselves with positive and supportive people, focus on what truly matters, and live in the present moment. Remember, we can't change the people around us, but we can change the people around us.
