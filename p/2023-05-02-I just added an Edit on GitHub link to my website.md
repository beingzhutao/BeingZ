title: "I just added an "Edit on GitHub" link to my website! ðŸ¥³"

Have you ever wanted to contribute to a website, but found it difficult to do so? Perhaps you came across a typo, or wanted to add some new information, but didn't know how to make the change. Well, fear not! By adding an "Edit on GitHub" link to your website, you can make it easier for users to contribute to your content.

Recently, I spent almost an hour figuring out how to add an "Edit on GitHub" link to my website. It was a challenging task, as I had to understand how to generate the correct link and then redirect the user to the correct page on my website after they made their edits on GitHub. But in the end, I succeeded, and I'm so happy about it!

Here's how it works: when a user clicks on the "Edit on GitHub" link that I added to my website, they are taken to the GitHub editor for the file that corresponds to the page they are currently viewing. This means that they can make changes to the content of the page directly in the GitHub editor, without having to navigate to my website's content management system or contact me directly.

Once the user has made their changes and submitted a pull request, I receive a notification that there is a new proposed change to the file. I can review the changes, provide feedback if necessary, and then merge the changes into my website's source code if they are acceptable. This means that users can contribute to my website's content in a more streamlined and efficient manner, without the need for back-and-forth communication or complex technical knowledge.

Adding an "Edit on GitHub" link to your website is a great way to encourage collaboration and contributions from your users. It makes it easier for them to suggest changes, report issues, and contribute to the improvement of your content. While it may take some effort to set up initially, it's definitely worth the time investment in the long run.

In conclusion, I'm glad that I was able to add an "Edit on GitHub" link to my website, and I encourage other website owners to consider doing the same. By doing so, you can make it easier for your users to contribute to your content, and ultimately improve the quality and accuracy of your website.

It is so easy when you realize it is just one line code, lol.
