New Jersey holds a special place in my heart as it was the first state I visited in the USA when I came here as an international student to pursue my studies. 📚🎓

New Jersey is a beautiful state with so much to offer, from its stunning hiking mountains 🏔️ to its vibrant sports scene 🎾🏀🏈. I've learned so much during my time here, both academically and personally.

I remember my first hike in the South Mountain Reservation 🥾, and the stunning views that awaited me at the top. It was an unforgettable experience, and one that I will always cherish.

As for sports, I've had the opportunity to learn how to play tennis 🎾 and have attended many sports events, including a few NFL games 🏈. It's been an amazing way to immerse myself in American culture, and I've enjoyed every minute of it!

But it's not just about the outdoor activities and sports. I've also been able to try a variety of new foods 🍔🍟 and have had the chance to pursue advanced studies in my field of interest. The opportunities here are truly endless, and I feel so lucky to be able to learn and grow in this amazing state.

And of course, I've made many friends along the way! 🤗 It's been great to meet people from all over the world and to practice my English language skills.

Overall, New Jersey has been an amazing experience for me, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is considering studying abroad in the USA. 🌎🤓
