title: "Mar.2 - Mar.3 Camping Ski again but more fun"
---

This weekend is a symphony of excitement and relaxation. Saturday kicks off with skiing in Pennsylvania, after 4pm,  followed by a lively night at the bar, playing pool till the 10pm. Seeking solace, I camp  at Wawa. Sunday brings another exhilarating ski day before heading home. It's a whirlwind of adventure, laughter, and newfound friendships, leaving me rejuvenated for the week ahead.

Camping took an unexpected turn when I watched a film, drifting off to sleep amidst the movie's soundtrack. Stirring at midnight, I ventured to Wawa's restroom before slipping back into slumber. Awakening at 9 am, the aroma of adventure lingered as I savored a Wawa lunch, grabbing coffee and bread for the road. With renewed vigor, I hit the slopes for a day of skiing. It was an unconventional yet unforgettable camping escapade, blending relaxation with unexpected delightsâ€”a testament to the magic of spontaneity in the great outdoors.
