📝📱🤔 Let's talk about note-taking! As someone who takes notes daily, I find it to be a simple yet essential practice. I started jotting down my to-do list during my high school days, and since then, it has become an integral part of my daily routine.

👀 Looking back, I have used a variety of note-taking apps over the years. During high school, I had a journal note that I carried with me everywhere. It helped me capture ideas, thoughts, and plans, and I still have it to this day! I even found notes in there about learning Java and planning a trip to another village.

🎓 When I got to college, I tried using the Apple note-taking app, but it didn't work for me. I couldn't sync the notes to my computer, and I had to log in and verify every time I wanted to access them on my PC, which was a hassle. So, I tried different online note-taking apps like Microsoft OneNote and Evernote. Eventually, I settled on using the Simplenote app because of its simplicity and ability to sync across multiple devices.

🔐 However, I became concerned about the safety of my notes on Simplenote and started searching for a new app. I tried almost every note-taking app I could find on the internet, even attempting to create my own note-taking app from the Github opensource. Sadly, I failed to create it with Notejs, so I continued my search for something I could trust.

🤩 That's when I discovered Google Docs, and it's been a game-changer for me! I now use Google Docs to take my notes and sync them through Google Drive. It's easy to use, and I love the fact that I can access my notes from any device. I might be using Google Docs for the next three years, or even the next 20 years!

🙌 I'm grateful that I've developed this habit of note-taking, and I encourage everyone to give it a try. It's a simple yet powerful practice that can make a big difference in your life. So, what's your favorite note-taking app? Let me know in the comments below!
