📹🎬🎥 I Want To BeYoutuber 🎥🎬📹

 I have just started my journey on YouTube, and I would be so grateful if you could follow me at [@ZhutaoGuru](https://www.youtube.com/@ZhutaoGuru) 💻🔍

I've always been fascinated by the idea of being a YouTuber. It's a great platform to share ideas, record my life, and connect with people from all over the world. However, with limited time, family commitments, and my hobbies, I've found it hard to commit to it full-time.

But that hasn't stopped me from pursuing my dream. I want to use this platform to share my passion for biochemistry, computational chemistry, math, and my hobbies. I believe that knowledge should be shared, and what better way to do it than through YouTube!

In the world of biochemistry, there are so many exciting things to explore, and I can't wait to share my discoveries with you. Computational chemistry is another field that I'm passionate about. It's amazing how we can use computers to solve complex problems in chemistry, and I want to share that knowledge with others.

But it's not all about science and math. I also want to share my hobbies with you. I love hiking, reading, and cooking, and I want to show you how these activities bring me joy and relaxation in my busy life.

Living in this world can be challenging, but it's also full of wonder and beauty. I want to share my experiences and perspectives on life with you. I believe that by connecting and sharing our stories, we can learn so much from each other.

So, follow me on this journey, and let's explore the world of biochemistry, computational chemistry, math, and my hobbies together. I promise to share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences with you. And who knows, maybe we can even collaborate on something exciting!
