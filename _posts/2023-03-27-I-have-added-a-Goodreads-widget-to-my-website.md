📚🖥️ Hey everyone, I am excited to share that I have added a Goodreads widget to my website! 🎉 This will allow you to see what books I've read and what's on my [reading list](https://www.zhutaosheng.com/s/hobbies-reading). Goodreads is an amazing website that helps you keep track of your reading goals and book recommendations.

To add the widget to my website, I created an HTML code that I inserted into my blog. Now, you can find the widget on the reading page of my website. I am continuously working to improve and add new functions to my website, so stay tuned for more updates! 🤩

As my website continues to grow and develop, I will keep you all updated on my progress. It's like watching a baby grow up! Once I finish all the technical work, I will start focusing on creating new and exciting content. For example, I am considering starting my own YouTube channel to share my thoughts on books and other interesting topics.

So please check out my book list on my [Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157526677-zhutao) and leave a comment below to let me know what you think! Your feedback means a lot to me and will help me improve my website even more. Thanks for your support! 🙏🏼 #Goodreads #BookList
