Have you ever been told that an activity you love is "useless" or a waste of time? Just because some people might perceive certain activities as such, it doesn't mean they don't hold value or meaning to others.

Take gardening or tending to plants, for example. Some might see it as a mundane task, but for others, it brings a sense of calmness and fulfillment as they watch their plants grow and flourish. Similarly, listening to or playing music can have therapeutic effects and bring joy to one's life.

Writing or journaling may seem pointless to some, but for others, it's a way to process emotions, reflect on experiences, and improve their mental health. Reading books or literature can expand our knowledge and empathy, while cooking or baking allows us to explore new flavors and express our creativity.

Engaging in art or crafts can be seen as a hobby, but it can also improve our cognitive and fine motor skills. Watching movies or TV shows may be seen as a form of entertainment, but it can also inspire us and broaden our perspectives.

Exercising or working out might seem like a chore to some, but it can boost our physical and mental health and provide us with a sense of accomplishment. Spending time in nature or hiking can also have positive effects on our well-being and help us connect with the world around us.

Lastly, practicing mindfulness or meditation might seem like a trendy buzzword, but it can improve our focus, reduce stress, and increase our overall happiness.

So don't let anyone tell you that an activity you enjoy is "useless." Find what brings you joy and meaning in life, and embrace it. Remember, what may seem like a waste of time to one person may hold immense value to another. Embrace your passions and live your life to the fullest!
