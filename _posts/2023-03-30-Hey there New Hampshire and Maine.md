👋 Hey everyone! I wanted to share about my experiences visiting New Hampshire and Maine as part of a program I joined a while back.

🌲 New Hampshire was our second stop on the journey, and it was an amazing experience staying at Kroka organization. We arrived after a long journey, but we were quickly welcomed by the staff and settled into our accommodations. The dinner that was prepared for us was made from locally sourced ingredients and was absolutely delicious.

🔥 One of the highlights of the trip for me was learning how to properly and safely split wood. This was a traditional activity at Kroka, and I was able to gain new skills while also learning about the importance of sustainable living. Spending the evening in the big yurt with fellow guests and staff was a cozy and welcoming experience that allowed us to bond and learn more about the culture and traditions of the region.

❄️ Maine was our third and final stop, and it was a winter wonderland! We went on a dog sledding adventure through the snowy wilderness, which was an incredible experience. Our guide made sure to emphasize the importance of sustainability and ecotourism, and we used eco-friendly camping gear and equipment.

🌳 One of the most impactful moments for me was when we set up camp for the night in the great outdoors. We were able to fully immerse ourselves in the wilderness and connect with nature in a way that is not possible in our daily lives. This experience reminded me of the importance of preserving the natural world for future generations.

🌟 All in all, these experiences in New Hampshire and Maine were unforgettable, and they have left a lasting impact on me. I am grateful for the opportunity to have visited such beautiful places and to have learned so much along the way.
