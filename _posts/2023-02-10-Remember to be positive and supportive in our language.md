🤝🗣️ One of the most important skills we can learn is how to communicate effectively with others. Recently, I had the pleasure of learning some valuable tips on how to ask people questions and say things the right way.

👋🏼🤔 One of the simplest but most effective tips I learned was how to start a conversation by asking "How are you?" This greeting is a great way to open up communication with someone and show that you care about their well-being.

👷‍♀️💼 Another tip I learned was how to ask about someone's job or projects they are working on. Instead of simply asking, "What do you do?" or "What projects are you working on?", try asking "What type of projects are you interested in?" or "What's your favorite thing about your job?" These questions can lead to more interesting and engaging conversations.

💬👍🏼 It's also important to remember to be positive and supportive in our language. For example, instead of saying "That's not a good idea," try saying "That's an interesting idea, have you thought about this angle?" This way, we can still offer constructive feedback while remaining encouraging.

🙏🏼🤝 Lastly, always remember to be respectful and courteous in our language and tone. Saying "please" and "thank you" can go a long way in building positive relationships with others.
