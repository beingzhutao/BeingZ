From my experience, I've learned that there are some philosophies of life that are more important than others. One of these is to do what you want to do. Life is long, and it's important to spend it doing things that make you happy.

It can be easy to get caught up in what other people think you should be doing or what society expects of you. But at the end of the day, you're the one who has to live with the choices you make. So why not make choices that align with your own values and desires?

If you're an introvert like me, it can be challenging to speak up and assert yourself. But I've found that going to someone else's side and asking questions is a great way to start a conversation and learn more about others. It's called talking, and it's no big deal. It's a way to connect with others and build deeper relationships.

Another important philosophy of life is to show your talent. We all have unique gifts and abilities, and it's important to share them with the world. Whether it's writing, art, music, or something else entirely, don't be afraid to let your talent shine.

When you focus on yourself and your own passions, you'll find that the things around you are naturally attracted to you. You'll attract positivity, opportunities, and people who share your interests.

So let's remember to do what we want to do. Life is long, so live it for yourself. Don't be afraid to go to someone else's side and ask questions. #dowhatyouwanttodo
