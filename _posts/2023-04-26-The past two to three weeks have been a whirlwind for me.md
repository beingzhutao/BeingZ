The past two to three weeks have been a whirlwind for me. I've been trying to figure out how to deal with my life, but it feels like everything is upside down. 😔

I've been sleeping a lot, yet staying up at night, which has left me feeling tired and disoriented. 😴 But amidst all the chaos, I've been holding onto my dream of hiking. 🌲🥾🌄

Unfortunately, the rain seems to always come on weekends, which has made it hard for me to get out and hit the trails. But that doesn't mean I've given up on my goal. 💪

Instead, I've been exploring other activities to do indoors. From cooking new recipes to reading books, I'm finding ways to stay entertained and keep my mind off of the challenges in my life. 📚🍳

I know that things may seem tough right now, but I'm determined to keep pushing forward. With every obstacle that comes my way, I'm learning to adapt and find new ways to thrive. 💪

And who knows, maybe one day soon, I'll finally get to hit the trails and make my hiking dreams a reality. 🌄🌅
