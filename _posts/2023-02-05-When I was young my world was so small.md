title: "When I was young, my world was so small👦"

🌾👦 When I was young, my world was so small. 🌍 Born in a countryside with limited access to education and resources, I didn't know much about the world outside of my village. 😔

I remember spending most of my time playing with the other kids in the area and being with my family. 🏡 We didn't have many fancy toys or gadgets, but we always found ways to have fun and be creative with what we had.

Growing up, I didn't even know much about the United States, let alone other places around the world. 🤔 I was content with my simple life in the countryside and didn't think much about what else was out there.

It wasn't until I got older and had the opportunity to travel and learn more about different cultures and places that my worldview began to expand. 🌎 I was amazed by all the different ways of life and the beauty of this world.

I also realized how fortunate I was to have grown up with a loving family and a tight-knit community.  It's something that I will always cherish and be grateful for, no matter where life takes me.

While I may not have had access to a lot of formal education or resources when I was younger, I learned so much from my experiences and the people around me. 🧠 And I am grateful for the lessons that have shaped me into the person I am today.

Looking back, I realize how much my upbringing has influenced my perspective on life and my values. 🙏 It has taught me to appreciate the simple things, to value community and relationships, and to always strive to learn and grow.

I may have started with a small worldview, but I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that have allowed me to expand it over time. 🌍 And I hope to continue to learn and grow throughout my life, no matter where it takes me.
