🌅🌎 This photo is my bike! Actually, it's my third bike since I came to the US just six months ago - unbelievable! 😱 Unfortunately, I lost my expensive one, and it's a bad story. 😔 But despite that setback, I still love biking and going on adventures. 🤩 There's nothing quite like the feeling of the wind in your hair as you pedal towards your destination! 🌬️💨 Whether it's a quick ride around town or a longer journey to a new place, biking always brings me joy. 😊 So here's to all the fellow bike lovers out there - let's hit the road and see where our wheels take us! 🙌🏼🚴‍♀️🚴‍♂️ #ilikebike #bikingtosomewhere #adventuretime #mythirdbike
