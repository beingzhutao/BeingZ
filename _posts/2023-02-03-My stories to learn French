title: "My stories to learn French!🇫🇷"

📚🇫🇷 My stories to learn French! It's been a long time since I was in college, and I wanted to learn a third language, so I chose French class. But the teacher let us quit, so I gave up on learning French in a traditional setting. 😕

After that, I turned to online resources, but even then, I still consider myself a beginner. 😔 Despite that, I didn't give up entirely. For almost a year now, I've been immersing myself in French culture and music, listening to a lot of French chansons, and I really like them! 🎶

Surprisingly, even though I'm still a beginner, I can understand a lot of French words and sentences. It's been a great experience overall! 🤗 Learning a new language is never easy, but it's definitely worth it. 🌟
