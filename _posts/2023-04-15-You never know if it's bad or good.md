title: "You never know if it's bad or good🤔"

The world can be complex,
A mystery we can't comprehend,
You never know if it's bad or good,
It can seem like it never ends.

🤔❌❤️🙏🏼

But I prefer to trust in the good,
And give second chances whenever I could,
I don't want to hold onto hate,
I hope everyone's doing great.

🌻🌈🌟🌺

Let's spread love and light,
And make the world a little more bright,
With compassion and empathy,
We can create a better society.
