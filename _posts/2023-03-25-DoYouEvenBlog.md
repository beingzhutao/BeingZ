title: "Do You Even Blog?"
---

👋🏻 Hey everyone! I'm excited to share that I've just created my very first blog! It's been an amazing journey so far, filled with learning and growth, and I can't wait to share it all with you. 😍

The first step was thinking of a name for my blog, which was definitely a challenging task. After much brainstorming, I finally settled on the name "[zhutaosheng.com](http://zhutaosheng.com/)" It just had a certain ring to it that I couldn't resist. 😉

Next, I purchased the domain and applied it to [Github](https://github.com/zhutaosheng/zhutaosheng.github.io), and that's when the real fun began! I wanted to create a platform where I could share my ideas and journal entries with you all, and doing it through my own website seemed like the perfect way to do it. 🌟

You might be wondering why I didn't just use [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) or [Wix](https://wordpress.com/) to create my website. Well, the truth is, I wanted to be able to customize my website exactly the way I wanted it. I didn't want to be limited by pre-made templates or features. 🙅🏻‍♀️

One of my top priorities was to make my website minimal and beautiful, so I scoured [Github](https://github.com/) for templates that would fit the bill. Eventually, I stumbled upon a minimal template that I fell in love with, and I immediately backed it up on my Github account. If you like it too, be sure to give it a star! ⭐️

As I delved into the world of website creation, I also began to understand code more deeply. I learned about Latex, Markdown, HTML, and other tools that are essential to creating a functional website. And now, I can confidently say that I have a good handle on how to control my website. 💪

I have to give a shoutout to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) for being my personal AI assistant throughout this process. Most of the icons and code that I learned were generated by this amazing tool, and it helped me to quickly and efficiently create my website. I'm so grateful for the help it provided in processing many tedious things. 🤖

Going forward, I'll be here sharing all kinds of stuff with you guys, from my thoughts on life to my latest journal entries. I hope you'll follow me on social media and check out my website regularly. Your support is so important to me, and it will help me to continue to share my journey with you. ❤️

In conclusion, I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported me thus far. Creating a blog has been an incredible experience, and I can't wait to see what the future holds. So, here's to new beginnings and endless possibilities!
