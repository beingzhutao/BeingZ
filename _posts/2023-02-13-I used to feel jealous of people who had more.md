title: "I used to feel jealous of people who had moreðŸ™Œ"
---

Two years ago, I used to feel jealous of people who had more luxury items or traveled to many places. But now, I no longer care about those things. I've come to realize that some things are meant for us, and some are not. As long as I'm happy, healthy, and doing what I love, I'm rich enough.

Living a minimalist lifestyle has taught me to appreciate the simple things in life, like spending time in nature, practicing yoga, and hiking. I no longer feel the need to accumulate material possessions or compete with others for who has more.

I find peace in having less, and it has reduced my mental stress. I'm grateful for what I have and enjoy the present moment. This mindset shift has been my growth and has given me a sense of fulfillment that I never felt before.

Remember, you don't need to have everything to be happy. Sometimes, less is more. What makes you truly rich is having a grateful heart and finding joy in the present moment. Embrace the simple things in life, and you'll find happiness in the most unexpected places.
