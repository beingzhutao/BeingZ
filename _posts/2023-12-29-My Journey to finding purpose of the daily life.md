title: "My Journey to finding purpose of the daily life"
---

Lately, my days have been painted in hues of contentment and clarity. It feels like I've unlocked a door to a tranquil realm where anxiety no longer reigns and possibilities stretch out like an endless horizon. It's a profound shift—one that has granted me the solace of knowing where my focus lies and the sheer joy of embracing it.

For the longest time, I pondered the path I should tread after completing my Ph.D. in Chemistry. The future felt like an expansive canvas waiting for the stroke of my decision. Yet, amidst this uncertainty, a revelation struck me—it's the role of a chemist that truly resonates with me. Whether in the sphere of corporate pursuits or imparting knowledge in academia, the allure of chemistry’s enigmatic world captivates me.

But arriving at this realization wasn't solely about pinpointing a career choice. It was a culmination of introspection, a realization that finding one's passion requires silencing the noise of the world and listening to the whispers of your heart.

I learned the importance of decluttering my mental space, of freeing myself from the incessant pull of social media and the allure of mindless video games. It’s astonishing how liberating it feels to detach from these distractions. By shedding the weight of unnecessary consumption, I've discovered an abundance of time—a precious currency—to revel in the richness of life.

I cannot stress enough how paramount it is to allocate time deliberately, to carve moments dedicated solely to pursuits that nourish the soul. It’s in this balanced approach, where work aligns harmoniously with personal passions and leisure, that the true essence of life reveals itself.

In this moment, I'm reveling in the simple joy of existence. Each day brings with it a renewed sense of purpose, a deep-seated contentment that stems from embracing what truly matters.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned on this journey, it’s this: life isn’t about the cost or the worth attached to our pursuits. It's about finding that elusive equilibrium, where dedication to our aspirations doesn't come at the expense of our well-being and happiness.

So here I am, relishing the sweetness of a life untangled from anxiety, a life illuminated by the pursuit of chemistry, and a life enriched by moments intentionally savored. I invite you to embark on this journey of self-discovery and intentional living. Trust me, the view from this side of the fence is breathtaking.

In the end, it’s not about the destination—it’s about the joyous, fulfilling journey we craft for ourselves.
