title: "Purpose that's been on my mind lately💜"

Something that's been on my mind lately. I've been feeling a little down lately, and I've been trying to figure out why. After some reflection, I think it might be because I'm lacking a sense of purpose in my life.

I've realized that I don't want to do things just because I "should" or because other people think I should. I want to do things that bring me joy and fulfillment, that align with my passions and interests.

Thankfully, I have some hobbies that I'm really passionate about, like hiking and climbing. These activities make me feel alive and connected to the world around me. I've been trying to do them more often and make them a bigger part of my life.

Relationship problems and feeling disconnected from others aren't the issue for me right now. I'm not in a relationship, but that's okay. I don't need someone else to make me happy. I'm learning to be content with myself and enjoy my own company.

I know that finding your purpose in life can be a challenge. It's easy to get caught up in what other people think you should do, or to feel like you're just going through the motions. But I believe that we all have something that we're meant to do, something that brings us joy and makes the world a better place.

So, if you're feeling like I am right now, take some time to reflect on what really matters to you. What are you passionate about? What makes you feel alive? What gives you a sense of purpose and meaning?

Thanks for listening, friends. 💜
