zs378@newark.rutgers.edu

I am from Rutgers University who has a great interest in chemistry, also an amateur programmer, I guess.  And I come from [Motherland🏯](/s/motherland).

Check my [advisors](/s/advisors). 

🧩 When I'm not in the lab, you'll catch me chasing trails through lush forests 🌳, carving slopes on skis, seeking thrilling adventures, or lost in the pages of a captivating book 📚. Life's all about exploring every puzzle piece of excitement! 🏞️❄️📖 Also You can check my [hobbies](/s/hobbies-more).
