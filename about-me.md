## About me

zs378@newark.rutgers.edu

I am from Rutgers University who has a great interest in chemistry, also an amateur programmer, I guess.  And I come from [Motherland🏯](/s/motherland).

My advisors are [here](/s/advisors). 


🧩 When I'm not in the lab, you can find me hiking through nature 🌳, climbing mountains 🧗‍♀️, or diving into a good book 📚.
